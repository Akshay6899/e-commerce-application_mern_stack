### Production Deployment
AWS Deployment Steps

1. Backend: Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk

2. Frontend: Build and upload to S3 + CloudFront

3. Database: Use MongoDB Atlas

## 1. Backend to Elastic Beanstalk
cd backend

# Initialize EB environment
eb init

# Create and deploy
eb create ecommerce-production
eb deploy

## 2. Frontend to S3 + CloudFront
cd frontend
npm run build

# Upload build/ to S3 bucket
aws s3 sync build/ s3://your-bucket-name --delete

# Create CloudFront distribution
# Configure S3 bucket as origin

## 3. Database Configuration

Use MongoDB Atlas production cluster
Configure IP whitelisting
Set up database users
